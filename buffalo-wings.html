        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I <strong>highly</strong> recommend trying the Crispy Buffalo Wings recipe from Natasha's Kitchen.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for a <strong>healthier</strong> alternative to fried buffalo wings that still delivers 
                on flavor and crispiness, this recipe is definitely worth trying. Plus, you can enjoy the wings in 
                the comfort of your own home without having to go out to a restaurant.</p>
            <p>If you're not a fan of chicken wings, you can even try making buffalo cauliflower wings using a similar recipe</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Chicken wings. Use <em>fresh or thawed frozen</em> wings that are broken down into <strong>drumettes</strong> and <strong>wingettes</strong></p>
            <p>Baking powder. The <strong>secret ingredient</strong> for getting your chicken wings <em>ultra-crispy</em> without the need for deep frying</p>
            <p>Salt. We use <strong><em>fine sea salt</em></strong> in nearly all of our cooking</p>
            <p>Garlic powder. It adds a bit of <em>zest</em> to your wings before tossing them in the <strong>buffalo sauce</strong></p>
            <p>Unsalted butter. It adds a <strong><em>nice creaminess</em></strong> to the buffalo sauce</p>
            <p>Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce-This is the <em>perfect</em> base for your wing sauce. It's <strong>tangy, a little sweet,</strong>
                and has just the right amount of spiciness.</p>
            <p>Sugar-helps the sauce <strong>caramelize and thicken</strong> on your piping hot wings.</p>
