            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1lb.</strong> dried elbow pasta</li>
                        <li><strong>1/2</strong> cup unsalted butter</li>
                        <li><strong>1/2</strong> cup all purpose flour</li>
                        <li><strong>1 1/2</strong> cups whole milk</li>
                        <li><strong>2 1/2</strong> cups half and half</li>
                        <li><strong>4</strong> cups shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                        <li><strong>2</strong> cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
                        <li><strong>1/2</strong>Tbsp. salt</li>
                        <li><strong>1/2</strong> tsp. black pepper</li>
                        <li><strong>1/4</strong> tsp. paprika</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>Preheat</em> oven to <strong>325</strong> degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Bring a <strong>large</strong> pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute 
                            less than the package directs for <em>al dente</em>. Drain and drizzle with a little bit of 
                            olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
                        <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, then 
                            <strong>divide into three piles</strong>.  <strong>Approximately 3 cups</strong> for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for 
                            the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
                        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over <strong>MED heat</strong>. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to 
                            combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand. Cook for approximately 
                            <strong>1 minutes</strong>, whisking often.  Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the half 
                            and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining half and 
                            half and the whole milk, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
                        <li>Continue to heat over <strong>MED heat</strong>, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick 
                            consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
                        <li><em>Remove</em> from the heat and stir in spices and <strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> of the cheeses, stirring 
                            to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
                        <li>In a <em><strong>large mixing bowl,</strong></em> combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully.  
                            Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Top with <strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> 
                            of shredded cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the top with the last <strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> of cheese and bake for <em>15 minutes,</em> 
                            until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</li>
                    </ol>
